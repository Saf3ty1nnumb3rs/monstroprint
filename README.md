# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run test:coverage`

Runs the full suite of Jest tests and will produce a coverage report. Additionally, if the coverage thresholds for the project are not met, it will return a non-zero exit code.

The coverage report is printed to the console in a summarized table, but is also generated in a `/coverage` directory. This directory includes a generated site that can provide more info on what parts are covered versus not. See [this article](https://medium.com/@krishankantsinghal/how-to-read-test-coverage-report-generated-using-jest-c2d1cb70da8b) for more info on how to read this report.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
